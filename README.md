This is a simple ISP adapter, which can be used to convert from 10-pin ISP to 6-pin ISP connectors and features a pin header for manual connections.

If you are etching the PCB yourself, you can either etch a double-side PCB or simply glue the transparent foil on the PCB to have pin indications.

Schematic and board are made in Eagle 6.1.0.
